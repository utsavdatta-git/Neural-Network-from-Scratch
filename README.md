# Neural Network from Scratch
A project to create a multi layer neural network from scratch using just numpy!

## neural_network package contains:
activation_functions.py to define all activation functions and their derivatives
hidden_layer.py to define one hidden layer of the network
mlp.py to define the whole network with a set of hidden layers

## experiments package contains:
experiments.py to perform experiments with various combinations of network size, activation functions and optimizations
train vs validation accuracy and loss plots for all experiments
one final experiment on mnist dataset for submission to kaggle

## test package contains:
comparison test cases between the numpy implementaion and a similar keras model
